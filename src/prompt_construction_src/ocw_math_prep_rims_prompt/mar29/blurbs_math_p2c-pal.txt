Problem:
Find the domain of the expression  $\frac{\sqrt{x-2}}{\sqrt{5-x}}$.}
`Method`: Plan-and-then-Code (p2c)
`Attempt 1`: 
def solution():
    '''
    The domain of the expression $\frac{\sqrt{x-2}}{\sqrt{5-x}}$ is determined by the conditions under which both the numerator and denominator are defined and the denominator is not zero. Specifically:

    1. The numerator $\sqrt{x-2}$ requires $x-2 > 0$, which implies $x > 2$. (Mistake: Using a strict inequality instead of a non-strict inequality)
    2. The denominator $\sqrt{5-x}$ requires $5-x \geq 0$, which implies $x \leq 5$. (Correct)

    Combining these two conditions, the domain of the expression is $2 < x \leq 5$. 
    '''
    # Since the domain is a simple condition, we return it as a string, incorrectly with parentheses instead of brackets.
    return "(2,5]"
`Answer 1`: (2,5]
`Evaluation`: Wrong
`Mistakes`: The mistake in Attempt 1 is the use of a strict inequality for the square root of `x - 2`. The correct inequality should allow `x - 2` to be equal to zero (i.e., `x - 2 >= 0`), because the square root function is defined for non-negative numbers (including zero). Therefore, the domain for `x` in this part should start from `2` and not just greater than `2`. Also, the answer should be given using bracket notation for intervals, which should be `[2, 5)` rather than `(2, 5]`.
`Hint for a better Method choice`: The Chain of Thought (cot) method could help articulate the reasoning behind the domain restrictions correctly in a step-by-step manner, potentially avoiding the misunderstanding of inequality signs.

`Answer 1`: (2,5]
`Evaluation`: Wrong
`Mistakes`: The first attempt incorrectly used a strict inequality for the square root in the numerator. The square root is defined for all non-negative numbers, not just strictly positive ones, meaning the inequality should be non-strict ($x-2 \geq 0$, not $x-2 > 0$). Additionally, returning the domain in incorrect notation (parentheses instead of brackets) suggests a misunderstanding of interval notation for domains.

If the system of equations

\begin{align*}
6x-4y&=a,\\
6y-9x &=b.

    '''
    The function solution returns the answer to the algebraic problem presented.

    We are given a system of equations:
    6x - 4y = a  (1)
    6y - 9x = b  (2)

    We need to find the value of a/b, assuming x and y are both nonzero, and b is nonzero.

    Step by step, we can transform the system of equations to express a in terms of b:

    From equation (1), we can express x in terms of y and a:
    6x = a + 4y  =>  x = (a + 4y)/6  (3)

    We can substitute x from equation (3) into equation (2) to find a relation between y and b, but we will make a mistake in the algebra:
    6y - 9((a + 4y)/6) = b
    Simplify the equation:
    6y - (3a + 12y)/2 = b
    Multiply through by 2:
    12y - 6a - 24y = 2b
    Simplify further:
    -12a = 2b  =>  a = -6b  (4)

    Now we have an incorrect relation for a in terms of b. The ratio a/b is then:
    a/b = (-6b) / b
    Simplify by canceling out b:
    a/b = -6

`Mistakes`: The mistakes in the first attempt are incorrect algebraic manipulation and simplification. Specifically, when substituting x from equation (3) into equation (2), the solver did not correctly distribute the -9 across the terms (a + 4y)/6, leading to an incorrect equation.
