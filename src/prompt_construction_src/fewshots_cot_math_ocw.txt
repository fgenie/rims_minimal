CORRECT

To find the domain of the expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$, we must consider two main constraints:

1. The radicand (the expression inside the square root) of the numerator, $x - 2$, must be greater than or equal to zero.
2. The radicand of the denominator, $5 - x$, must be greater than zero (not merely non-negative since the denominator cannot be zero).

Let's address these constraints.

For the numerator, we want $x - 2 \\geq 0$, which simplifies to:
$$x \\geq 2.$$

For the denominator, we want $5 - x > 0$, which simplifies to:
$$x < 5.$$

Now we combine these two inequalities to find the domain where both conditions are met:
$$2 \\leq x < 5.$$

This is an interval from 2 to 5, including 2 but not including 5.

Therefore, the domain of the expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$ is $[2, 5)$.
$[2, 5)$

            "Problem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B} = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n",

WRONG (chatgpt suggested to add instead of product)... so I manually fixed it.
The determinant of the product of two square matrices is equal to the sum of their determinants. Therefore, if you have two matrices $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ with determinants $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B} = 12$, respectively, then the determinant of their product $\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}$ is given by:

$$\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})+(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = 2 + 12 = 14.$$

So, $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = 12$.,
$\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = 12$

question 2
            "Problem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift the same total weight?\n",


WRONG (manual)
Terrell usually lifts 20-pound weights 12 times. 

      First, we look at the total weight lifted with the 20-pound weights:
      $$
      \text{Total weight with 20-pound weights} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ pounds}
      $$

      Now, equate this with two 15-pound weights lifted \(n\) times:
      $$
      2*15*n = 240
      $$

      solving for \(n\) would give us:
      $$
      n = \frac{240}{30} = 8
      $$

      This suggests that Terrell needs to lift the 15-pound weights 8 times.

Arginine is an amino acid with three groups that can be protonated and contribute to its net charge, depending on the solution's pH:\n\n1. The carboxyl group (-COOH), which typically has a pKa around 2.17.\n2. The amino group (-NH3+), with a pKa around 9.04.\n3. The side chain (guanidinium group, -C(NH2)2+), which has a pKa of approximately 12.48.\n\nAt a pH of 1.0, all three groups are in their protonated forms due to the low pH value being well below their respective pKa values. The carboxyl group would be COOH, the amino group would be NH3+, and the side chain would be protonated as well. The net charge of arginine in this situation is the sum of the charges of these groups:\n\n- The carboxyl group (-COOH) is neutral at this pH.\n- The amino group (-NH3+) carries a charge of +1.\n- The guanidinium group (-C(NH2)2+) carries a charge of +1.\n\nNet charge = 0 (from -COOH) +1 (from -NH3+) +1 (from -C(NH2)2+)\n\nNet charge = +2\n\nThus, the net charge of arginine in a solution of pH 1.0 is +2.\n\nFinal answer: The net charge of arginine at pH 1.0 is +2.",

question 3
WRONG chatgpt3.5 temp 1.2
Subproblem 1: Find the fourth power of $z$. 

Solution:
We start by finding $z^2$:
$z^2 = (1+\sqrt{3}i)(1+\sqrt{3}i) = 1 + 2\sqrt{3}i + 3i^2 = 1 + 2\sqrt{3}i - 3 = -2 + 2\sqrt{3}i$

Now, we can find $z^4$ by squaring $z^2$:
$( -2 + 2\sqrt{3}i)^2 = 4 - 4(2\sqrt{3}) + 12i -4 = -12 - 8\sqrt{3}i$

Therefore, $z^4 = -12 - 8\sqrt{3}i$. 

Subproblem 2: Identify $a, b$ such that $z^4 = a + bi$. 

From our previous calculations, we can see that $a=-12$ and $b=-8\sqrt{3}$. 

Therefore, the ordered pair $(a,b) = (-12, -8\sqrt{3})$.
