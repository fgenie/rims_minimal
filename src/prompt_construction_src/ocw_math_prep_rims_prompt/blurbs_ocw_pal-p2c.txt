`Mistakes`: The mistake in the first attempt is a misunderstanding of the protonation state of the carboxyl group at low pH. The code incorrectly assumes that the carboxyl group has a charge of 0 at pH 1.0, when in fact it should be positively charged due to protonation. The protonation state of each group at a given pH is determined by whether the pH is above or below the respective pKa value; if the pH is below the pKa, the group is protonated and if the pH is above, the group is deprotonated.

`Hint for a better Method choice`: Planning the steps carefully before coding will ensure the correct understanding of protonation states at given pH values and their contributions to net charge.



====================



0
`Mistakes`: The program logic incorrectly assigns the carboxyl group a charge of 0 at pH 1.0. In reality, the carboxyl group (COOH) would donate a proton at a pH higher than its pKa, becoming negatively charged (COO-). At pH 1.0, which is lower than its pKa, the carboxyl group is protonated and should have a charge of -1.

`Hint for a better Method choice`: Chain of Thought (cot) could allow a more reasoned approach to understanding how the charge states of the acid groups of arginine vary with pH, leading to a correct calculation of net charge.



====================



1
`Mistakes`: The mistake in the first attempt is in the definition of the differential equation where subtraction is used instead of addition. There's also an error in the characteristic polynomial; the term with x should have been replaced with '1', not x with '1'.

`Hint for a better Method choice`: A chain of thought could better ensure that each step follows the correct mathematical process without getting lost in translation to code.



====================



1
`Mistakes`: The initial attempt used subtraction instead of addition in the differential equation, leading to an incorrect characteristic equation. Furthermore, in the characteristic equation, the term with x should be replaced by 1, not subtracted by 1.

`Hint for a better Method choice`: Using a Plan-and-then-Code method can help in clearly outlining the steps to find the characteristic polynomial, reducing the risk of translating the equation incorrectly into code.



====================



2
`Mistakes`: The first attempt incorrectly calculates $z^4$ as $z^2$. The power is not raised correctly; it should be raised to the fourth power instead of the second.

`Hint for a better Method choice`: Use the Plan-and-then-Code method to ensure the steps are planned correctly, especially the correct computation of $z^4$.



====================



2
`Mistakes`: The first attempt only calculated $z^2$ instead of $z^4$. The variable `z_4` was incorrectly named as it actually contains the square of z, not its fourth power.

`Hint for a better Method choice`: Using the Plan-and-then-Code method would ensure step-by-step verification and the correct calculation of $z^4$, rather than stopping at $z^2$.
