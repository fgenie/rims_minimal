You are now solving math word problems. You brilliantly detects the errors in the wrong solution and find `Method` to correct the solution. The methods you are taking are as follows. Each has its strength and weakness:

- Chain of Thought (cot): Solving problem with writing steps of reasoning in a natural language. Might help correct understanding of the problem but this could be weaker in precise computation.
- Program-aided Language Modeling (pal): Using python language to reason and obtain an accurate answer to the given question, but this could be weaker in understanding the problem. 
- Plan-and-then-Code (p2c): When a question seems requiring amount of steps to reach the answer, write plans first for what to compute and write a python code to it for solving the problem. However if planning goes wrong, the code will also be wrong. If any steps of planning provided before programming, then it will be considered as Plan-and-then-Code.

Followings are the examples of correcting the wrong solutions with a `Method` based on diagnosis (`Mistakes`) and `Hint for a better Method choice`.




`Question`: Jerry is making cherry syrup. He needs 500 cherries per quart of syrup. It takes him 2 hours to pick 300 cherries and 3 hours to make the syrup. How long will it take him to make 9 quarts of syrup?
`Method`: Plan-and-then-Code (p2c)
`Attempt 1`: 1. Determine the total number of cherries needed to make 9 quarts of syrup. Multiply the number of cherries needed per quart (500) by the number of quarts (9).
2. Calculate how many hours Jerry takes to pick the cherries for one quart and then for 9 quarts. He picks 300 cherries in 2 hours, so determine the number of hours needed per cherry, which is 2/300 hours per cherry. Then multiply this by the total number of cherries needed for 9 quarts.
3. Add the time taken to make the syrup, which is 3 hours for one batch of syrup. Since it's not mentioned that making syrup time multiplies when quantity increases, we'll assume that the time remains constant regardless of the number of quarts.
4. Add the total time to pick cherries for 9 quarts to the time taken to make the syrup to get the total time to make 9 quarts of cherry syrup.
5. Return the result as the total time required for the whole process.
def solution():
    cherries_per_quart = 500
    quarts_to_make = 9
    picking_time = 2  # hours for 300 cherries
    making_time = 3  # hours for syrup, regardless of quantity

    # Total cherries needed
    total_cherries_needed = cherries_per_quart * quarts_to_make
    
    # Time to pick cherries for one quart
    time_per_cherry = picking_time / 300
    total_picking_time = time_per_cherry * total_cherries_needed

    # Total time: picking + making
    total_time = total_picking_time + making_time  # Making time is the same regardless of quantity
    
    return total_time

`Question`: A man drives 60 mph for 3 hours.  How fast would he have to drive over the next 2 hours to get an average speed of 70 mph?
`Method`: Plan-and-then-Code (p2c)
`Attempt 1`: 1. Understand that the average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken.
2. Start by calculating the distance the man has already traveled by multiplying his current speed of 60 mph by 3 hours. Let's call this `distance_initial`.
3. Calculate the total distance he would need to have traveled in 5 hours (3 hours already traveled + 2 more hours) to have an average speed of 70 mph. Let's call this `total_distance_required`.
4. Calculate the remaining distance he has to cover in the next 2 hours by subtracting `distance_initial` from `total_distance_required`.
5. To find out the speed he has to drive for the next 2 hours, divide the remaining distance by 2 hours. Let's call this speed `required_speed_next_2_hours`.
6. Return the `required_speed_next_2_hours`, which is the speed at which the man must drive to achieve an average speed of 70 mph by the end of the 5 hours.
def solution():
    # Given data
    current_speed = 60  # mph
    current_time = 3    # hours
    average_speed = 70  # mph for total 5 hours

    # 1. Calculate the distance initially traveled
    distance_initial = current_speed * current_time

    # 2. Calculate the total distance required to have an average of 70 mph over 5 hours
    total_time = current_time + 2
    total_distance_required = average_speed * total_time

    # 3. Calculate the remaining distance to cover in the next 2 hours
    remaining_distance = total_distance_required - distance_initial

    # 4. Calculate the speed to drive for next 2 hours to cover the remaining distance
    required_speed_next_2_hours = remaining_distance / 2

    return required_speed_next_2_hours

# Example usage of the function
# print(solution())  # Expected speed for the next 2 hours to maintain an average speed of 70 mph.

`Question`: There are enough provisions in a castle to feed 300 people for 90 days. After 30 days, 100 people leave the castle. How many more days are left until all the food runs out?
`Method`: Program-aided Language Modeling (pal)
`Attempt 1`: 
def solution():
    initial_people = 300
    provisions_for_days = 90
    days_passed = 30
    people_left = 100
    
    # Calculate total provisions for 300 people for 90 days
    total_provisions = initial_people * provisions_for_days
    
    # Calculate provisions consumed in 30 days
    provisions_consumed = initial_people * days_passed
    
    # Calculate remaining provisions after 30 days
    remaining_provisions = total_provisions - provisions_consumed
    
    # Calculate number of people remaining after 100 people leave
    remaining_people = initial_people - people_left
    
    # Calculate how many days provisions will now last with the remaining 200 people
    days_remaining = remaining_provisions // remaining_people
    
    return days_remaining

# Call the function and print the result
print(solution())

Now, try the `Question` below following the same procedure as above. Try the question with the choice of your `Method`, and evaluate the `Answer`. If your `Attempt` is considered wrong, identify the `Mistakes` and reason to take `Method` by writing `Hint for a better Method choice`. Based on it, make a correct reattempt.
