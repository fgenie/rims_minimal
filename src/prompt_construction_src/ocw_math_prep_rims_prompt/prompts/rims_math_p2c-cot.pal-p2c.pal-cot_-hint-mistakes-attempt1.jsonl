{"role": "user", "content": "You are now solving math/science problems. You brilliantly detects the errors in the wrong solution and find `Workaround Method` to correct the solution. The methods you are taking are as follows. Each has its strength and weakness:\n\n- Chain of Thought (cot): Solving problem with writing steps of reasoning in a natural language. Might help correct understanding of the problem but this could be weaker in precise computation.\n- Program-aided Language Modeling (pal): Using python language to reason and obtain an accurate answer to the given question, but this could be weaker in understanding the problem.\n- Plan-and-then-Code (p2c): When a question seems requiring amount of steps to reach the answer, write plans first for what to compute and write a python code to it for solving the problem. However if planning goes wrong, the code will also be wrong. If any steps of planning provided before programming, then it will be considered as Plan-and-then-Code.\n\nFollowings are the examples of correcting the wrong solutions with a `Workaround Method` based on diagnosis (`Mistakes`) and `Hint for a better Method choice`.\n\n\n\n\n`Question`: \nProblem:\nIf the system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n`Method`: Chain of Thought (cot)\n`Attempt 1`: \nLet's examine the system of equations:\n\\\\begin{align*}\n    6x - 4y &= a \\\\quad (1) \\\\\\\\\n    6y - 9x &= b \\\\quad (2)\n    \\\\end{align*}\n\nTo find $\\\\frac{a}{b}$, we can solve for $x$ in terms of $y$ (or $y$ in terms of $x$) by rearranging one of the equations and then substitute it into the other equation.\n\nFrom equation (1), we can rearrange for $x$:\n\\\\begin{align*}\n    6x &= a + 4y \\\\\\\\\n    x &= \\\\frac{a}{6} + \\\\frac{2}{3}y \\\\quad (3)\n    \\\\end{align*}\n\nNow, let's substitute this into equation (2):\n\\\\begin{align*}\n    6y - 9\\\\left(\\\\frac{a}{6} + \\\\frac{2}{3}y\\\\right) &= b \\\\\\\\\n    6y - \\\\frac{3}{2}a - 6y &= b \\\\\\\\\n    -\\\\frac{3}{2}a &= b\n    \\\\end{align*}\n\nMultiplying both sides by $-\\\\frac{2}{3}$ gives us:\n\\\\begin{align*}\n    a &= -\\\\frac{2}{3}b\n    \\\\end{align*}\n\nThus, the ratio $\\\\frac{a}{b}$ is:\n\\\\begin{align*}\n    \\\\frac{a}{b} &= -\\\\frac{2}{3}\n    \\\\end{align*}\n\nSince the problem states that there exists a solution $(x, y)$ where both $x$ and $y$ are nonzero, we can conclude the ratio without solving for the actual values of $x$ and $y$ because the ratio only depends on the coefficients of $x$ and $y$ in the equations.\n\nFinal Answer: The ratio $\\\\frac{a}{b}$ is $-\\\\frac{2}{3}$.\n`Answer 1`: -\\frac{2}{3}\n`Evaluation`: Correct\n\n\n\n`Question`: \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times.
