The atomic diameter can be approximated as the lattice parameter divided by the square root of 2 for the FCC structure.\n\n6. **Find the Planar Packing Fraction**: The PPF is the ratio of the area occupied by atoms to the total area of the plane.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\nStep 1: FCC crystal structure is already known.\n\nStep 2: The lattice parameter is \\( a = 4.05 \\) Ã….\n\nStep 3: In the (110) plane, atoms are at the corners and the center of the edges of the unit cell.\n\nStep 4: The area of the (110) plane within the unit cell is the face diagonal times the cell edge, which is \\( \\sqrt{a^2 + a^2} \\times a = a\\sqrt{2} \\times a = a^2\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nStep 5: The diameter of an atom in the FCC structure is approximately \\( \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}} \\), so the radius is \\( \\frac{a}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\). The area of one atom projected onto the plane is \\( \\pi \\left(\\frac{a}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi a^2}{8} \\).\n\nStep 6: In the (110) plane, there are two atoms fully within the plane per unit cell (each corner atom is shared by four unit cells, and each edge center atom is shared by two unit cells). Therefore, the total area occupied by atoms is \\( 2 \\times \\frac{\\pi a^2}{8} = \\frac{\\pi a^2}{4} \\).\n\nThe PPF is then the total area occupied by atoms divided by the total area of the plane:\n\\[ \\text{PPF} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi a^2}{4}}{a^2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\pi}{4\\sqrt{2}} \\]\n\nNow let's calculate the value and round it to three decimal places:\n\\[ \\text{PPF} = \\frac{\\pi}{4\\sqrt{2}} \\approx \\frac{3.1416}{4\\sqrt{2}} \\approx \\frac{3.1416}{5.6569} \\approx 0.555 \\]\n\nFinal answer: The planar packing fraction of the (110) plane in aluminum at 300 K is approximately 0.555 (rounded to three decimal places)."], "pal": ["To calculate the planar packing fraction for the (110) plane in an aluminum crystal, we need to know that aluminum has a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure.
