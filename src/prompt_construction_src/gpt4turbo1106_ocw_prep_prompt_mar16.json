Let's adjust the Python code to return this ratio directly.\n\n```python\ndef find_ratio_a_to_b_directly():\n    # Since we know that a = 3*(-2b/3)\n    # The ratio of a to b is -2 to 3\n    ratio_a_to_b =",
                    "To find the ratio \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\), we can solve the system of equations for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and then use these to express \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Since the problem states that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are both nonzero, and that \\(b\\) is nonzero, we can safely divide by the coefficients of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) as required. \n\nHere's how we can solve it using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# Define the equations\neq1 = Eq(6*x - 4*y, 'a')\neq2 = Eq(6*y - 9*x, 'b')\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolutions = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\n\n# The solutions will give us expressions for x and y in terms of a and b\n# We then need to substitute these into the original equations to find a/b\n\na_expr = 6*solutions[x] - 4*solutions[y]\nb_expr = 6*solutions[y] - 9*solutions[x]\n\n# Since we know that solutions[x] and solutions[y] are the expressions for x and y, \n# we can directly calculate a/b using the expressions\na_over_b = a_expr / b_expr\n\n# Simplify the expression\na_over_b_simplified = a_over_b.simplify()\n\na_over_b_simplified\n```\n\nNow we'll run this Python code to get the value of \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\)."

This means that the alpha carboxyl group will have no charge (as COOH), the alpha amino group will have a +1 charge (as NH3+), and the guanidinium side chain will also have a +1 charge. \n\nThus, the net charge would be the sum of these charges:\n\nNet Charge = Charge of COOH + Charge of NH3+ + Charge of guanidinium side chain\n           = 0 + (+1) + (+1)  (since at the very acidic pH of 1.0, these groups are fully protonated or not dissociated)\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_net_charge_at_ph1():\n    COOH_charge = 0  # Fully protonated, no charge\n    NH3_charge = +1  # Fully protonated\n    guanidinium_charge = +1  # Fully protonated\n    net_charge = COOH_charge + NH3_charge + guanidinium_charge\n    return f\"+{net_charge}\"\n```\nNow, let's run the calculation:\n\n```python\nprint(calculate_net_charge_at_ph1())\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, you'd get the result `+2`, as that is the net charge of arginine at pH 1.0.",
