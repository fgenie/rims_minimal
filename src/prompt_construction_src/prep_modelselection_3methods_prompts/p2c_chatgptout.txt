Question: Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?
1. Start by defining a variable to store Olivia's initial amount of money, let's call it "money_initial" and store 23 as its value.
2. Define another variable to store the cost of each bagel, let's call it "bagel_cost" and assign 3 as its value.
3. Define another variable to represent the number of bagels Olivia bought, let's call it "num_bagels" and assign 5 as its value.
4. Calculate the total cost of the bagels Olivia bought by multiplying "bagel_cost" and "num_bagels".
5. Subtract the total cost of the bagels from Olivia's initial amount of money to find out how much money she has left.
6. Return the result of the subtraction.
def solution():
    money_initial = 23
    bagel_cost = 3
    num_bagels = 5

    total_cost = bagel_cost * num_bagels
    money_left = money_initial - total_cost

    return money_left

Question: Michael had 58 golf balls. On tuesday, he lost 23 golf balls. On wednesday, he lost 2 more. How many golf balls did he have at the end of wednesday?
1. Start by defining a variable to represent the initial number of golf balls Michael had, let's call it "initial_balls" and set it to 58.
2. Create another variable to represent the number of balls lost on Tuesday, let's call it "balls_lost_tuesday" and set it to 23.
3. Create another variable to represent the number of balls lost on Wednesday, let's call it "balls_lost_wednesday" and set it to 2.
4. Calculate the total number of balls remaining by subtracting the number of balls lost on Tuesday and Wednesday from the initial number of balls. Store the result in a variable called "balls_remaining".
   `balls_remaining = initial_balls - balls_lost_tuesday - balls_lost_wednesday`
5. Return the value of "balls_remaining" which represents the number of golf balls Michael had at the end of Wednesday.
def solution():
    initial_balls = 58
    balls_lost_tuesday = 23
    balls_lost_wednesday = 2

    balls_remaining = initial_balls - balls_lost_tuesday - balls_lost_wednesday

    return balls_remaining

Question: There were nine computers in the server room. Five more computers were installed each day, from monday to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room?
1. Start by setting a variable `num_computers` to represent the current number of computers in the server room.
2. Initialize `num_computers` to 9, as mentioned in the question.
3. Create a loop to iterate over the days from Monday to Thursday.
4. Inside the loop, increase `num_computers` by 5 each day.
5. After the loop finishes, the value of `num_computers` will represent the total number of computers in the server room. Return the final result.
def solution():
    num_computers = 9
    
    for _ in range(4):  # Monday to Thursday
        num_computers += 5
    
    return num_computers

Question: Shawn has five toys. For Christmas, he got two toys each from his mom and dad. How many toys does he have now?
1. Start by defining a variable to represent the initial number of toys Shawn has, let's call it "initial_toys" and assign it a value of 5.
2. Define two variables to represent the number of toys Shawn got from his mom and dad, let's call them "mom_toys" and "dad_toys". Initialize both variables with the value of 2 since Shawn got 2 toys from each parent.
3. Calculate the total number of toys Shawn has now by adding "initial_toys", "mom_toys", and "dad_toys".
4. Return the result, which represents the total number of toys Shawn has now.
def solution():
    initial_toys = 5
    mom_toys = 2
    dad_toys = 2
    
    total_toys = initial_toys + mom_toys + dad_toys
    
    return total_toys

Question: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?
1. Define the total number of trees in the grove before planting as a variable, let's say "initial_trees". Set "initial_trees" equal to 15.
2. Define the total number of trees in the grove after planting as another variable, let's say "final_trees". Set "final_trees" equal to 21.
3. Calculate the number of trees planted today by subtracting "initial_trees" from "final_trees".
4. Store the result in a variable, let's say "trees_planted_today".
5. Return the value of "trees_planted_today" as the answer.
def solution():
    initial_trees = 15
    final_trees = 21
    
    trees_planted_today = final_trees - initial_trees
    
    return trees_planted_today
