            #     To find the domain of the expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$, we must consider two main constraints:

            #     1. The radicand (the expression inside the square root) of the numerator, $x - 2$, must be greater than or equal to zero.
            #     2. The radicand of the denominator, $5 - x$, must be greater than zero (not merely non-negative since the denominator cannot be zero).

            #     Let's address these constraints.

            #     For the numerator, we want $x - 2 \\geq 0$, which simplifies to:
            #     $$x \\geq 2.$$

            #     For the denominator, we want $5 - x > 0$, which simplifies to:
            #     $$x < 5.$$

            #     Now we combine these two inequalities to find the domain where both conditions are met:
            #     $$2 \\leq x < 5.$$

            #     This is an interval from 2 to 5, including 2 but not including 5.

            #     Therefore, the domain of the expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$ is $[2, 5)$.

            #     The determinant of the product of two square matrices is equal to the product of their determinants. Therefore, if you have two matrices $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ with determinants $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B} = 12$, respectively, then the determinant of their product $\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}$ is given by:

            #     $$\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = 2 \\cdot 12 = 24.$$

            #     So, $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = 24$.

                Solution:
                If Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times, he lifts a total weight of:
                $$
                \\text{Total weight with 20-pound weights} = 2 \\times 20 \\times 12 = 40 \\times 12 = 480 \\text{ pounds}
                $$

                If he uses two 15-pound weights instead, and lifts them $n$ times, his total lifted weight with the 15-pound weights will be:
                $$
                \\text{Total weight with 15-pound weights} = 2 \\times 15 \\times n = 30n \\text{ pounds}
                $$

                We want the total weight lifted with the 15-pound weights to equal the total weight lifted with the 20-pound weights:
                $$
                30n = 480
                $$

                To find $n$, we solve for it:
                $$
                n = \\frac{480}{30} = 16
                $$

                Terrell must lift the two 15-pound weights 16 times to lift the same total weight as when he lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times.

                Final Answer: Terrell must lift the 15-pound weights 16 times.

            #     Let's examine the system of equations:
            #     \\begin{align*}
            #         6x - 4y &= a \\quad (1) \\\\
            #         6y - 9x &= b \\quad (2)
            #         \\end{align*}

            #     To find $\\frac{a}{b}$, we can solve for $x$ in terms of $y$ (or $y$ in terms of $x$) by rearranging one of the equations and then substitute it into the other equation.

            #     From equation (1), we can rearrange for $x$:
            #     \\begin{align*}
            #         6x &= a + 4y \\\\
            #         x &= \\frac{a}{6} + \\frac{2}{3}y \\quad (3)
            #         \\end{align*}

            #     Now, let's substitute this into equation (2):
            #     \\begin{align*}
            #         6y - 9\\left(\\frac{a}{6} + \\frac{2}{3}y\\right) &= b \\\\
            #         6y - \\frac{3}{2}a - 6y &= b \\\\
            #         -\\frac{3}{2}a &= b
            #         \\end{align*}

            #     Multiplying both sides by $-\\frac{2}{3}$ gives us:
            #     \\begin{align*}
            #         a &= -\\frac{2}{3}b
            #         \\end{align*}

            #     Thus, the ratio $\\frac{a}{b}$ is:
            #     \\begin{align*}
            #         \\frac{a}{b} &= -\\frac{2}{3}
            #         \\end{align*}

            #     Since the problem states that there exists a solution $(x, y)$ where both $x$ and $y$ are nonzero, we can conclude the ratio without solving for the actual values of $x$ and $y$ because the ratio only depends on the coefficients of $x$ and $y$ in the equations.

            #     Final Answer: The ratio $\\frac{a}{b}$ is $-\\frac{2}{3}$.
