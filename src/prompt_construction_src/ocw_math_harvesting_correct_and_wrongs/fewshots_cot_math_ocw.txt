"Solution:
For the expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$ to be defined, the value inside the square root must be non-negative. This means that both $x-2 \\ge 0$ and $5-x \\ge 0$.

From $x-2 \\ge 0$, we get $x \\ge 2$.

From $5-x \\ge 0$, we get $x \\le 5$.

Combining the two inequalities, we have $2 \\le x \\le 5$.

Therefore, the domain of the expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$ is $\\boxed{[2,5]}$."

To find the domain of the expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$, we must consider two main constraints:

1. The radicand (the expression inside the square root) of the numerator, $x - 2$, must be greater than or equal to zero.
2. The radicand of the denominator, $5 - x$, must be greater than zero (not merely non-negative since the denominator cannot be zero).

Let's address these constraints.

For the numerator, we want $x - 2 \\geq 0$, which simplifies to:
$$x \\geq 2.$$

For the denominator, we want $5 - x > 0$, which simplifies to:
$$x < 5.$$

Now we combine these two inequalities to find the domain where both conditions are met:
$$2 \\leq x < 5.$$

This is an interval from 2 to 5, including 2 but not including 5.

Therefore, the domain of the expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$ is $[2, 5)$.
$[2, 5)$

"Solution:
To solve this system of equations, we can multiply the second equation by 2 to simplify the system:

\\begin{align*}
6x - 4y &= a,\\\\
12y - 18x &= 2b.
\\end{align*}

Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate $x$:

\\begin{align*}
6x - 4y + 12y - 18x &= a + 2b,\\\\
-12x + 8y + 12y - 18x &= a + 2b,\\\\
-30x + 20y &= a + 2b.
\\end{align*}

Dividing the equation by 10, we get:

\\begin{align*}
-3x + 2y &= \\frac{a + 2b}{10}.
\\end{align*}

Since $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero, we can divide the equation by 2:

\\begin{align*}
-1.5x + y &= \\frac{a + 2b}{20}.
\\end{align*}

This implies that $\\frac{a}{b} = \\boxed{-3}$.

$\\frac{a}{b} = \\boxed{-3}$

Let's examine the system of equations:
\\begin{align*}
6x - 4y &= a \\quad (1) \\\\
6y - 9x &= b \\quad (2)
\\end{align*}

To find $\\frac{a}{b}$, we can solve for $x$ in terms of $y$ (or $y$ in terms of $x$) by rearranging one of the equations and then substitute it into the other equation.

From equation (1), we can rearrange for $x$:
\\begin{align*}
6x &= a + 4y \\\\
x &= \\frac{a}{6} + \\frac{2}{3}y \\quad (3)
\\end{align*}

Now, let's substitute this into equation (2):
\\begin{align*}
6y - 9\\left(\\frac{a}{6} + \\frac{2}{3}y\\right) &= b \\\\
6y - \\frac{3}{2}a - 6y &= b \\\\
-\\frac{3}{2}a &= b
\\end{align*}

Multiplying both sides by $-\\frac{2}{3}$ gives us:
\\begin{align*}
a &= -\\frac{2}{3}b
\\end{align*}

Thus, the ratio $\\frac{a}{b}$ is:
\\begin{align*}
\\frac{a}{b} &= -\\frac{2}{3}
\\end{align*}

Since the problem states that there exists a solution $(x, y)$ where both $x$ and $y$ are nonzero, we can conclude the ratio without solving for the actual values of $x$ and $y$ because the ratio only depends on the coefficients of $x$ and $y$ in the equations.

Final Answer: The ratio $\\frac{a}{b}$ is $-\\frac{2}{3}$.
$-\\frac{2}{3}$

WRONG (chatgpt suggested to add instead of product)... so I manually fixed it.
The determinant of the product of two square matrices is equal to the sum of their determinants. Therefore, if you have two matrices $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ with determinants $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B} = 12$, respectively, then the determinant of their product $\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}$ is given by:

            "Problem:
            Terrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift the same total weight?
            ",


WRONG (manual)
Terrell usually lifts 20-pound weights 12 times. 

First, we look at the total weight lifted with the 20-pound weights:
$$
\text{Total weight with 20-pound weights} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ pounds}
$$

Now, equate this with two 15-pound weights lifted \(n\) times:
$$
2*15*n = 240
$$

solving for \(n\) would give us:
$$
n = \frac{240}{30} = 8
$$

This suggests that Terrell needs to lift the 15-pound weights 8 times.

CORRECT
src/prompt_construction_src/gpt4turbo1106_ocw_prep_prompt_mar16.json
Solution:
If Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times, he lifts a total weight of:
$$
\\text{Total weight with 20-pound weights} = 2 \\times 20 \\times 12 = 40 \\times 12 = 480 \\text{ pounds}
$$

If he uses two 15-pound weights instead, and lifts them $n$ times, his total lifted weight with the 15-pound weights will be:
$$
\\text{Total weight with 15-pound weights} = 2 \\times 15 \\times n = 30n \\text{ pounds}
$$

We want the total weight lifted with the 15-pound weights to equal the total weight lifted with the 20-pound weights:
$$
30n = 480
$$

To find $n$, we solve for it:
$$
n = \\frac{480}{30} = 16
$$

Terrell must lift the two 15-pound weights 16 times to lift the same total weight as when he lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times.

Final Answer: Terrell must lift the 15-pound weights 16 times.
$
n = \\frac{480}{30} = 16

Arginine is an amino acid with three groups that can be protonated and contribute to its net charge, depending on the solution's pH:

1. The carboxyl group (-COOH), which typically has a pKa around 2.17.
2. The amino group (-NH3+), with a pKa around 9.04.
3. The side chain (guanidinium group, -C(NH2)2+), which has a pKa of approximately 12.48.

At a pH of 1.0, all three groups are in their protonated forms due to the low pH value being well below their respective pKa values. The carboxyl group would be COOH, the amino group would be NH3+, and the side chain would be protonated as well. The net charge of arginine in this situation is the sum of the charges of these groups:

- The carboxyl group (-COOH) is neutral at this pH.
- The amino group (-NH3+) carries a charge of +1.
- The guanidinium group (-C(NH2)2+) carries a charge of +1.

Net charge = 0 (from -COOH) +1 (from -NH3+) +1 (from -C(NH2)2+)

Net charge = +2

Thus, the net charge of arginine in a solution of pH 1.0 is +2.

Final answer: The net charge of arginine at pH 1.0 is +2.",
+2

WRONG
src/prompt_construction_src/ocw_MATH_solved_chatgpt777.json
"Solution:
The net charge of arginine in a solution of pH 1.0 can be calculated by considering the pKa values of its ionizable groups. Arginine has three ionizable groups: the carboxyl group with a pKa around 2.2, the amino group with a pKa around 9.0, and the guanidinium group with a pKa around 12.5.

At pH 1.0:
- The carboxyl group will be protonated (+1 charge).
- The amino group will be protonated (+1 charge).
- The guanidinium group will be protonated (+1 charge).

Therefore, the net charge of arginine at pH 1.0 is +3.

Final answer: The net charge of arginine in a solution of pH 1.0 is +3.",

"Solution:
We can simplify the given Laplace Transform using partial fractions:
\\[Y(s) = \\frac{1}{(s+a)(s+b)} = \\frac{A}{s+a} + \\frac{B}{s+b}\\]

Multiplying both sides by \\((s+a)(s+b)\\) gives:
\\[1 = A(s+b) + B(s+a)\\]

Now, we can solve for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) by setting \\(s=-a\\) and \\(s=-b\\):
Setting \\(s=-a\\):
\\[1 = A(-a+b) \\implies A = \\frac{1}{b-a}\\]

Setting \\(s=-b\\):
\\[1 = B(-b+a) \\implies B = \\frac{1}{a-b}\\]

question 3
CORRECT
To solve the subproblem, we want to find $z^4$ where $z = 1 + \sqrt{3}i$. We start by writing $z$ in polar form. The polar form of a complex number is given by $z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)$, where $r$ is the magnitude of $z$ and $\theta$ is the argument of $z$.

First, we find the magnitude of $z$:
$$ r = |z| = \sqrt{1^2 + (\sqrt{3})^2} = \sqrt{1 + 3} = \sqrt{4} = 2 $$

Next, we find the argument $\theta$. The argument is the angle the complex number makes with the positive real axis. We have

$$ \tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{Im}(z)}{\text{Re}(z)} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{1} = \sqrt{3} $$

Therefore, $\theta = \arctan(\sqrt{3})$. Since $z$ is in the first quadrant, $\theta = \frac{\pi}{3}$.

Now we have the polar form of $z$:

$$ z = 2\left(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)\right) $$

By De Moivre's Theorem, to raise a complex number in polar form to an integer power $n$, we raise the magnitude to the power of $n$ and multiply the argument by $n$:

$$ z^n = r^n\left(\cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta)\right) $$

For $n = 4$, we get:

$$ z^4 = 2^4\left(\cos\left(4 \cdot \frac{\pi}{3}\right) + i\sin\left(4 \cdot \frac{\pi}{3}\right)\right) $$
$$ z^4 = 16\left(\cos\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)\right) $$

The angle $\frac{4\pi}{3}$ corresponds to one of the special angles in the unit circle, and its cosine and sine values are well known:

$$ \cos\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right) = -\frac{1}{2} $$
$$ \sin\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} $$

Therefore,

$$ z^4 = 16\left(-\frac{1}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) $$
$$ z^4 = -8 - 8\sqrt{3}i $$

So $a = -8$ and $b = -8\sqrt{3}$, and the ordered pair is $(-8, -8\sqrt{3})$.


WRONG chatgpt3.5 temp 1.2
Subproblem 1: Find the fourth power of $z$. 

Solution:
We start by finding $z^2$:
$z^2 = (1+\sqrt{3}i)(1+\sqrt{3}i) = 1 + 2\sqrt{3}i + 3i^2 = 1 + 2\sqrt{3}i - 3 = -2 + 2\sqrt{3}i$

Now, we can find $z^4$ by squaring $z^2$:
$( -2 + 2\sqrt{3}i)^2 = 4 - 4(2\sqrt{3}) + 12i -4 = -12 - 8\sqrt{3}i$

Therefore, $z^4 = -12 - 8\sqrt{3}i$. 

Subproblem 2: Identify $a, b$ such that $z^4 = a + bi$. 

From our previous calculations, we can see that $a=-12$ and $b=-8\sqrt{3}$. 

Therefore, the ordered pair $(a,b) = (-12, -8\sqrt{3})$.
