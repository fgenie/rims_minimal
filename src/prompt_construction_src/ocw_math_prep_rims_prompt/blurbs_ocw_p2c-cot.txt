`Question`: 
Problem:
Subproblem 0: What is the net charge of arginine in a solution of $\mathrm{pH} 1.0$? 
Please format your answer as +n or -n.
`Method`: Plan-and-then-Code (p2c)
`Attempt 1`: 
def solution():
    # pKa values for arginine (incorrect values)
    pKa_carboxyl = 3.0
    pKa_amino = 8.0
    pKa_guanidinium = 11.0

    # pH value for the solution
    pH = 1.0

    # Determine the charge state of each group at pH 1.0 (incorrect logic)
    charge_carboxyl = 1 if pH > pKa_carboxyl else 0
    charge_amino = -1 if pH > pKa_amino else 0
    charge_guanidinium = -1 if pH > pKa_guanidinium else 0

    # Calculate the net charge (incorrect calculation)
    net_charge = charge_carboxyl - charge_amino - charge_guanidinium

    # Format the net charge (correct formatting)
    formatted_charge = f"+{net_charge}" if net_charge >= 0 else f"{net_charge}"
    return formatted_charge
`Answer 1`: +0
`Evaluation`: Wrong
`Mistakes`: The attempt above wrongly calculates the net charge and also uses wrong charges for functional groups. Carboxyl group will not have a positive charge; protonation of the carboxyl group actually neutralizes its charge. Additionally, the guanidinium group already has a positive charge at neutral pH, and this charge does not change at pH 1.0. The amino group does carry a positive charge at low pH.
`Workaround Method`: Chain of Thought (cot)
`Attempt 2`: 
Arginine is an amino acid with three groups that can be protonated and contribute to its net charge, depending on the solution's pH:

1. The carboxyl group (-COOH), which typically has a pKa around 2.17.
2. The amino group (-NH3+), with a pKa around 9.04.
3. The side chain (guanidinium group, -C(NH2)2+), which has a pKa of approximately 12.48.

At a pH of 1.0, all three groups are in their protonated forms due to the low pH value being well below their respective pKa values. The carboxyl group would be COOH, the amino group would be NH3+, and the side chain would be protonated as well. The net charge of arginine in this situation is the sum of the charges of these groups:

- The carboxyl group (-COOH) is neutral at this pH.
- The amino group (-NH3+) carries a charge of +1.
- The guanidinium group (-C(NH2)2+) carries a charge of +1.

Net charge = 0 (from -COOH) +1 (from -NH3+) +1 (from -C(NH2)2+)

Net charge = +2

Thus, the net charge of arginine in a solution of pH 1.0 is +2.

Final answer: The net charge of arginine at pH 1.0 is +2.
`Answer 2`: $2$

$\ddot{x}+b \dot{x}+x=0$.
Subproblem 0: What is the characteristic polynomial $p(s)$ of

    The function solution returns the characteristic polynomial of the given differential equation.

    The differential equation given is:
    \[\ddot{x} + b\dot{x} + x = 0\]

    The characteristic equation is obtained by assuming a solution of the form \(x(t) = e^{rt}\), where \(r\) is a constant. This leads to the characteristic polynomial:
    \[r^2 + br + 1 = 0\]

    This is the characteristic polynomial p(r) for the given differential equation.

    return "r^2 + br + 1 = 0"
`Answer 1`: r^2 + br + 1 = 0
`Evaluation`: Wrong
`Mistakes`: The coefficient of the x term in the characteristic polynomial was incorrectly given as 1 instead of simply \(s^0\) or just \(1\). The correct characteristic polynomial should be \(s^2 + bs + 1\) rather than \(r^2 + br + 1\).
`Hint for a better Method choice`: A Chain of Thought method could allow for step-by-step derivation of the characteristic polynomial, ensuring that each term is correctly substituted.
`Workaround Method`: Chain of Thought (cot)
`Attempt 2`: 
The characteristic polynomial \\( p(s) \\) for a differential equation can be derived by replacing \\( \\ddot{x} \\) with \\( s^2 \\), \\( \\dot{x} \\) with \\( s \\), and \\( x \\) with 1.

Given the differential equation:

Replace \\( \\ddot{x} \\) with \\( s^2 \\), \\( \\dot{x} \\) with \\( s \\), and \\( x \\) with 1 to get the characteristic polynomial:
\\[ p(s) = s^2 + bs + 1 \\]

So the characteristic polynomial \\( p(s) \\) is \\( s^2 + bs + 1 \\).

    # Return the result as an ordered pair

`Answer 1`: Programming Error
`Evaluation`: Wrong
`Mistakes`: The attempt uses incorrect syntax for defining a complex number in Python. The `sqrt` function and `i` for the imaginary unit are not directly accessible without the correct module and the imaginary unit is represented by `j` in Python, not `i`. 
`Hint for a better Method choice`: Use Chain of Thought to manually calculate the power of the complex number, which avoids the syntax errors present in programming languages.
`Workaround Method`: Chain of Thought (cot)
`Attempt 2`: 
To solve the subproblem, we want to find $z^4$ where $z = 1 + \sqrt{3}i$. We start by writing $z$ in polar form. The polar form of a complex number is given by $z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)$, where $r$ is the magnitude of $z$ and $\theta$ is the argument of $z$.

First, we find the magnitude of $z$:
$$ r = |z| = \sqrt{1^2 + (\sqrt{3})^2} = \sqrt{1 + 3} = \sqrt{4} = 2 $$

Next, we find the argument $\theta$. The argument is the angle the complex number makes with the positive real axis. We have

$$ \tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{Im}(z)}{\text{Re}(z)} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{1} = \sqrt{3} $$

Therefore, $\theta = \arctan(\sqrt{3})$. Since $z$ is in the first quadrant, $\theta = \frac{\pi}{3}$.

Now we have the polar form of $z$:

$$ z = 2\left(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)\right) $$

By De Moivre's Theorem, to raise a complex number in polar form to an integer power $n$, we raise the magnitude to the power of $n$ and multiply the argument by $n$:

$$ z^n = r^n\left(\cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta)\right) $$

For $n = 4$, we get:

$$ z^4 = 2^4\left(\cos\left(4 \cdot \frac{\pi}{3}\right) + i\sin\left(4 \cdot \frac{\pi}{3}\right)\right) $$
$$ z^4 = 16\left(\cos\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)\right) $$

The angle $\frac{4\pi}{3}$ corresponds to one of the special angles in the unit circle, and its cosine and sine values are well known:

$$ \cos\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right) = -\frac{1}{2} $$
$$ \sin\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} $$

Therefore,

$$ z^4 = 16\left(-\frac{1}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) $$
$$ z^4 = -8 - 8\sqrt{3}i $$

So $a = -8$ and $b = -8\sqrt{3}$, and the ordered pair is $(-8, -8\sqrt{3})$.
`Answer 2`: $\left(-8, -8\sqrt{3}\right)$
`Evaluation`: Correct

`Mistakes`: The code uses undefined variables and functions like `sqrt`, `i`, and normal multiplication instead of complex multiplication provided by `cmath`.

$$ \tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{Im}(z)}{\text{Re}(z)} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{1} = \sqrt{3} $$

Therefore, $\theta = \arctan(\sqrt{3})$. Since $z$ is in the first quadrant, $\theta = \frac{\pi}{3}$.

Now we have the polar form of $z$:

$$ z = 2\left(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)\right) $$

By De Moivre's Theorem, to raise a complex number in polar form to an integer power $n$, we raise the magnitude to the power of $n$ and multiply the argument by $n$:

$$ z^n = r^n\left(\cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta)\right) $$

For $n = 4$, we get:

$$ z^4 = 2^4\left(\cos\left(4 \cdot \frac{\pi}{3}\right) + i\sin\left(4 \cdot \frac{\pi}{3}\right)\right) $$
$$ z^4 = 16\left(\cos\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)\right) $$

The angle $\frac{4\pi}{3}$ corresponds to one of the special angles in the unit circle, and its cosine and sine values are well known:

$$ \cos\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right) = -\frac{1}{2} $$
$$ \sin\left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} $$

Therefore,

$$ z^4 = 16\left(-\frac{1}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) $$
$$ z^4 = -8 - 8\sqrt{3}i $$

So $a = -8$ and $b = -8\sqrt{3}$, and the ordered pair is $(-8, -8\sqrt{3})$.
`Answer 2`: $\left(-8, -8\sqrt{3}\right)$
