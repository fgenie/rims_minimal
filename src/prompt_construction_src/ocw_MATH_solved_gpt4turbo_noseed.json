The alpha-carboxyl group has a pKa of approximately 2.0, which means at pH 1.0 it will also be fully protonated, but since it's a carboxyl group, it will be neutral rather than positively charged.\n\nSo we have:\n- Alpha-amino group: +1 charge\n- Alpha-carboxyl group: 0 charge (protonated, but not contributing to net charge)\n- Guanidinium group: +1 charge\n\nAdding these up, we get a net charge of +2 for arginine at pH 1.0.\n\nLet's format the answer in Python:\n\n```python\ndef arginine_net_charge_at_pH1():\n    # Charges at pH 1.0\n    alpha_amino_charge = +1\n    alpha_carboxyl_charge = 0\n    guanidinium_charge = +1\n\n    # Net charge calculation\n    net_charge = alpha_amino_charge + alpha_carboxyl_charge + guanidinium_charge\n    \n    return f\"+{net_charge}\"  # Format as +n\n\n# Let's call the function and print the result\nprint(arginine_net_charge_at_pH1())\n```\n\nWhen you run this Python code, it will return the formatted net charge of arginine at pH 1.0, which is \"+2\".",
