      There are three choices to the same math problem. One uses natural language to answer the question, while the other two uses Python program to answer it. One directly attempts to answer the problem with coding the solution, while the last one will plan first and then write a code to answer it. Three of them can correctly answer the math problem. You need to identify which choice can correctly answer the math problem. Here is one example how to do it,

      Math problem: Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?

      (A)
      Answer:
      Olivia had 23 dollars.
      5 bagels for 3 dollars each will be 5 * 3 = 15 dollars.
      So she has 23 - 15 = 8 dollars left.
      So the answer is 8.

      (B)
      def solution():
          money_initial = 23
          bagels = 5
          bagel_cost = 3
          money_spent = bagels + bagel_cost
          money_left = money_initial - money_spent
          result = money_left
          return result

      (C)
      def solution():
          '''
          Create a function solution that returns the answer of the following question: Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left? 
              
          Let's think step by step.
          1. Calculate the total cost of the bagels.
          2. Subtract the total cost from Olivia's original amount.
          3. Return the remaining amount.
          '''
          # Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the bagels
          bagel_cost = 3
          num_bagels = 5
          total_cost = bagel_cost * num_bagels
          
          # Step 2: Subtract the total cost from Olivia's original amount
          original_amount = 23
          remaining_amount = original_amount - total_cost - num_bagels
          
          # Step 3: Return the remaining amount
          return remaining_amount

      Which of the above three choices can correctly answer the math problem?

      (A) can correctly answer the math problem. Because (B) adds the number of bagels to the cost of each bagel instead of multiplying them, and (C) also fails by wrongly subtracting num_bagels from original_amount.

      Now it's your turn. Here is another math problem and three choices.
      Math Problem: Michael had 58 golf balls. On tuesday, he lost 23 golf balls. On wednesday, he lost 2 more. How many golf balls did he have at the end of wednesday?

      (A)
      Answer:
      Michael started with 58 golf balls.
      Then after losing 23 on tuesday, he had 58 -23 = 35.
      After losing 2 more, he had 35 + 2 = 37 golf balls.

      Math problem: There were nine computers in the server room. Five more computers were installed each day, from monday to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room?

      (A)
      Answer:
      There were originally 9 computers.
      For each of 4 days from monday to thursday, 5 more computers were added, that is, total 5 computers added for 4 days.
      So there are 9 + 5 = 14 computers now.

      Problem:
      Subproblem 0: What is the net charge of arginine in a solution of $\mathrm{pH} 1.0$? 
      Please format your answer as +n or -n.  

      (A)
      Solution:
      Arginine is an amino acid with three groups that can be protonated and contribute to its net charge, depending on the solution's pH:\n\n1. The carboxyl group (-COOH), which typically has a pKa around 2.17.\n2. The amino group (-NH3+), with a pKa around 9.04.\n3. The side chain (guanidinium group, -C(NH2)2+), which has a pKa of approximately 12.48.\n\nAt a pH of 1.0, all three groups are in their protonated forms due to the low pH value being well below their respective pKa values. The carboxyl group would be COOH, the amino group would be NH3+, and the side chain would be protonated as well. The net charge of arginine in this situation is the sum of the charges of these groups:\n\n- The carboxyl group (-COOH) is neutral at this pH.\n- The amino group (-NH3+) carries a charge of +1.\n- The guanidinium group (-C(NH2)2+) carries a charge of +1.\n\nNet charge = 0 (from -COOH) +1 (from -NH3+) +1 (from -C(NH2)2+)\n\nNet charge = +2\n\nThus, the net charge of arginine in a solution of pH 1.0 is +2.\n\nFinal answer: The net charge of arginine at pH 1.0 is +2.
