So we need $x-2 \\geq 0$. Solving for $x$ gives us $x \\geq 2$.\n    \n    ### Step 2: Restrictions for $\\sqrt{5-x}$\n    Similarly, for the square root in the denominator to be defined, its radicand must also be greater than zero (not just greater than or equal to, because it's in the denominator and cannot be zero). So we need $5-x > 0$. Solving for $x$ gives us $x < 5$.\n    \n    ### Step 3: Combine Restrictions\n    The domain of the expression is where both conditions are satisfied simultaneously. This means we need to find the overlap between $x \\geq 2$ and $x < 5$.\n    \n    ### Step 4: Interval Notation\n    The domain where both conditions overlap is from $x = 2$ to $x < 5$.

Arginine (Arg, R) has three groups that can pick up or lose protons: the alpha-amino group, the alpha-carboxyl group, and the guanidinium side chain. The pKa values for these groups are approximately:\n    \n    1. Alpha-amino group: pKa \u2248 9.0\n    2. Alpha-carboxyl group: pKa \u2248 2.0\n    3. Guanidinium side chain: pKa \u2248 12.5\n    \n    At a pH of 1.0, which is below the pKa of all the ionizable groups, the following will happen:\n    \n    - The alpha-amino group (NH3+) will be protonated because the pH is below its pKa, carrying a +1 charge.\n    - The alpha-carboxyl group (COOH) will also be protonated because the pH is below its pKa, so it will not carry a charge (COOH has no net charge when protonated).\n    - The guanidinium side chain (present in the R-group of arginine) will be protonated because the pH is below its pKa, carrying a +1 charge.\n    \n    Now let's calculate the net charge:\n    \n    1. Define the pKa values for the ionizable groups in arginine.\n    2. Determine the state of protonation for each group at pH 1.0.\n    3. Calculate the net charge by summing the charges from each ionizable group.\n    4.
