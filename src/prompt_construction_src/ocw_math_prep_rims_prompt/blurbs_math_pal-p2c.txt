`Question`: 
Problem:
Find the domain of the expression  $\frac{\sqrt{x-2}}{\sqrt{5-x}}$.}
`Method`: Program-aided Language Model (pal)
`Attempt 1`: 
def solution():
    """Find the domain of the expression sqrt(x-2) / sqrt(5-x)"""
    # The expression is defined when the denominator is not zero and the radicand is non-negative
    # Denominator is not zero when x != 5
    # Radicands are non-negative when x >= 2 and x <= 5
    domain = [x for x in range(2, 6) if x != 5]
    return domain
`Answer 1`: [2, 3, 4]
`Evaluation`: Wrong
`Mistakes`: The first attempt incorrectly assumes that the domain of the function consists of only integer values, and it does not consider the continuous nature of the domain.
`Hint for a better Method choice`: A 'Chain of Thought' approach would allow for a better conceptual understanding of the definition of domain and the continuous nature of the real numbers involved.
`Workaround Method`: Plan-and-then-Code (p2c)
`Attempt 2`: 
def solution():
    '''
    The domain of the expression $\frac{\sqrt{x-2}}{\sqrt{5-x}}$ is determined by the conditions under which both the numerator and denominator are defined and the denominator is not zero. Specifically:
    
    1. The numerator $\sqrt{x-2}$ requires $x-2 \geq 0$, which implies $x \geq 2$.
    2. The denominator $\sqrt{5-x}$ requires $5-x > 0$, which implies $x < 5$.
    
    Combining these two conditions, the domain of the expression is $2 \leq x < 5$.
    '''
    # Since the domain is a simple condition, we return it as a string, concisely with bracket and parenthesis.
    return "[2,5)"

Problem:
If $\det \mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\det \mathbf{B} = 12,$ then find $\det (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{B}).$
`Method`: Program-aided Language Model (pal)
`Attempt 1`: 
def solution():
    """If det A = 2 and det B = 12, find det(AB)."""

    det_A = 2
    det_B = 12

    # Wrong assumption: Adding determinants instead of multiplying
    det_AB = det_A + det_B

    result = det_AB

    return result
`Answer 1`: 14
`Evaluation`: Wrong
`Mistakes`: The mistake in the first attempt is that the determinants were added instead of multiplied when finding the determinant of the product of two matrices.
`Hint for a better Method choice`: The plan-and-then-code approach would outline the correct mathematical operations before writing the code, thus preventing the error of using the wrong operation (addition instead of multiplication).
`Workaround Method`: Plan-and-then-Code (p2c)
`Attempt 2`: 
def solution():
    # Step 1: Given values for determinants of A and B
    det_A = 2
    det_B = 12

    # Step 2: Calculate the determinant of the product of matrices A and B
    det_product = det_A * det_B

Problem:
If the system of equations

find $\frac{a}{b},$ assuming $b$ is nonzero.

    # Given equations: 6x-4y=a, 6y-9x=b
    # Since the system has a solution where x and y are both nonzero,
    # we can set these equations equal to each other and solve for a/b
    # 6x-4y = 6y-9x
    # 15x = 10y
    # x/y = 10/15 = 2/3

    b = 6*(3) - 9*(2)    # Substitute x=2, y=3 in second equation

    result = a / b
    return result
`Answer 1`: DividedByZero Error
`Evaluation`: Wrong
`Mistakes`: The attempt incorrectly tried to equate the two equations to solve for the ratio of \( \frac{a}{b} \) by setting \( 6x-4y \) equal to \( 6y-9x \), which is not a valid operation since \( a \) and \( b \) are not necessarily the same. The attempt fails because it does not correctly manipulate the equations to isolate \( \frac{a}{b} \). Moreover, there is no check to ensure that the substitution made does not result in division by zero.
`Hint for a better Method choice`: Use Chain of Thought to algebraically manipulate the equations first to express \( a \) and \( b \) in terms of \( x \) and \( y \), and then find \( \frac{a}{b} \). This could better ensure understanding the algebraic steps necessary before committing to code.

    The function solution returns the answer to the algebraic problem presented.

    We are given a system of equations:
    6x - 4y = a  (1)
    6y - 9x = b  (2)

    We need to find the value of a/b, assuming x and y are both nonzero, and b is nonzero.

    Step by step, we can transform the system of equations to express a in terms of b:

    From equation (1), we can express x in terms of y and a:
    6x = a + 4y  =>  x = (a + 4y)/6  (3)

    We can substitute x from equation (3) into equation (2) to find a relation between y and b:
    6y - 9((a + 4y)/6) = b
    Simplify the equation:
    6y - (3/2)(a + 4y) = b
    Multiply through by 2 to clear the fraction:
    12y - 3a - 12y = 2b
    Simplify further:
    -3a = 2b  =>  a = -2b/3  (4)

    Now we have a in terms of b. The ratio a/b is then:
    a/b = (-2b/3) / b
    Simplify by canceling out b:
    a/b = -2/3

    Since this is a fixed algebraic solution, we simply return the result.

`Answer 1`: DividedByZero Error
`Evaluation`: Wrong
`Mistakes`: The attempt incorrectly solved the system by arbitrarily assigning values to x and y and assuming they can be set equal to each other. Since x and y are variables in a system of equations, we can't arbitrarily substitute values for x and y without solving the system properly. The operation of setting the two equations equal to each other without using valid algebraic manipulation led to an incorrect approach and eventually a DividedByZero Error, which isn't valid in this case.
`Hint for a better Method choice`: Use chain of thought or plan-and-then-code to algebraically manipulate the system of equations to find the correct relationship between `a` and `b`, thereby avoiding arbitrary substitutions and calculations that lead to invalid operations.
