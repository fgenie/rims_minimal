`Question`: 
Problem:
Subproblem 0: What is the net charge of arginine in a solution of $\mathrm{pH} 1.0$? 
Please format your answer as +n or -n.
`Method`: Program-aided Language Model (pal)
`Attempt 1`: 
def calculate_charge_of_arginine(pH, pKa_carboxyl=2.17, pKa_amino=9.04, pKa_guanidinium=12.48):
    # At pH 1.0, the carboxyl group COOH is protonated and has a charge of 0.
    charge_carboxyl = 0 if pH < pKa_carboxyl else -1
    
    # At pH 1.0, the amino group NH3+ is protonated and has a charge of +1.
    charge_amino = +1 if pH < pKa_amino else 0
    
    # At pH 1.0, the guanidinium group is protonated and has a charge of +1.
    charge_guanidinium = +1 if pH < pKa_guanidinium else 0
    
    # Net charge is the sum of individual group charges.
    net_charge = charge_carboxyl + charge_amino + charge_guanidinium
`Answer 1`: Programming Error
`Evaluation`: Wrong
`Mistakes`: The primary mistake in the first attempt is not considering the protonation state of the carboxyl group at pH 1.0 correctly. Contrary to the comment in the code, at a pH less than its pKa, the carboxyl group is actually not neutral but protonated and carries a positive charge. Similarly, the amino and guanidinium groups are protonated and carry a positive charge at a pH less than their pKas.
`Hint for a better Method choice`: Using Plan-and-then-Code approach would allow careful consideration of the protonation states of functional groups and help in correctly implementing the conditionals based on pH and pKa values.
`Workaround Method`: Plan-and-then-Code (p2c)
`Attempt 2`: 
def solution():
    # pKa values for arginine
    pKa_carboxyl = 2.0
    pKa_amino = 9.0
    pKa_guanidinium = 12.5
    
    # pH value for the solution
    pH = 1.0
    
    # Determine the charge state of each group at pH 1.0
    charge_carboxyl = 0 if pH < pKa_carboxyl else -1
    charge_amino = 1 if pH < pKa_amino else 0
    charge_guanidinium = 1 if pH < pKa_guanidinium else 0
    
    # Calculate the net charge
    net_charge = charge_carboxyl + charge_amino + charge_guanidinium
    
    # Format the net charge
    formatted_charge = f"+{net_charge}" if net_charge >= 0 else f"{net_charge}"
    return formatted_charge
`Answer 2`: $2$

Problem:
Preamble: The following subproblems refer to the differential equation 
$\ddot{x}+b \dot{x}+x=0$.
Subproblem 0: What is the characteristic polynomial $p(s)$ of 
$\ddot{x}+b \dot{x}+x=0$?
`Method`: Program-aided Language Model (pal)
`Attempt 1`: 
import sympy as sp
from sympy import symbols, Function, Eq, diff

def solution():
    # Define the symbols
    t, b, s = symbols('t b s')
    x = Function('x')(t)
    
    # Define the differential equation incorrectly
    diffeq = Eq(diff(x, t, t) - b * diff(x, t) - x, 0)  # Faulty: Used subtraction instead of addition
    
    # Find the characteristic equation by replacing d^2x/dt^2 with s^2, dx/dt with s, and x with 1
    
    # This is also done incorrectly due to the incorrect differential equation
    char_eq = diffeq.subs({diff(x, t, t): s**2, diff(x, t): s, x: 1}).lhs
    
    return sp.latex(char_eq)
`Answer 1`: - b s + s^{2} - 1
`Evaluation`: Wrong
`Mistakes`: The wrong differential equation was used in the initial code, as it included subtraction instead of addition. Also, the equation was not set up correctly to find the characteristic polynomial because x should have been replaced with 1, not the derivatives.
`Hint for a better Method choice`: Use Chain of Thought to manually derive the characteristic polynomial before coding, this helps to ensure understanding of the problem and prevent algebraic mistakes.
`Workaround Method`: Plan-and-then-Code (p2c)

`Question`: 
Problem:
Subproblem 0: Let $z = 1 + \sqrt{3} i$. Find $a, b$ that satisfy the equation 
$z^4 = a + bi$. Express your answer as the ordered pair $(a,b)$.
`Method`: Program-aided Language Model (pal)
`Attempt 1`: 
from sympy import symbols, I, sqrt, latex

def solution():
    # define and simplify the complex number
    z = 1 + sqrt(3) * I
    z_4 = z**2 
    z_4_simplified = z_4.expand(complex=True)

    # Extract real and imaginary parts 
    a = z_4_simplified.as_real_imag()[0]
    b = z_4_simplified.as_real_imag()[1]

    return latex(a), latex(b)
`Answer 1`: ('-2', '2 \sqrt{3}')
`Evaluation`: Wrong
`Mistakes`: The mistake in the first attempt is that the computation for \( z^4 \) only calculates \( z^2 \). The variable `z_4` should represent \( z \) raised to the power of 4, but instead, it's only raised to the power of 2. 
`Hint for a better Method choice`: A plan-and-then-code approach would ensure that each step of the computation is planned and thus more likely to catch that \( z \) needs to be raised to the fourth power, not the second.
