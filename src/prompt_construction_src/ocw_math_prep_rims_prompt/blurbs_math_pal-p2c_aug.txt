`Question`: 
Problem:
Terrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift the same total weight?
`Method`: Program-aided Language Model (pal)
`Attempt 1`: 
def solution():
    weight1 = 20
    weight2 = 15
    lifts1 = 12
    # assuming that the number of lifts is proportional to the weight
    lifts2 = lifts1 * (weight2 / weight1)
    return lifts2
`Answer 1`: 9
`Evaluation`: Wrong
`Mistakes`: The error in Attempt 1 is the assumption that the number of lifts is directly proportional to the weight of the dumbbells. However, this does not take into account the fact that the total weight lifted is the product of the weight per lift and the number of lifts, which must remain constant to satisfy the problem's conditions.
`Hint for a better Method choice`: A plan with the correct mathematical relationship for total weight lifted would avoid the erroneous proportional assumption made in the first attempt.
`Workaround Method`: Plan-and-then-Code (p2c)

    '''
    Create a function solution that returns the answer of the following question: Problem:
    Terrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift the same total weight?
    
    Let's think step by step.
    1. Calculate the total weight lifted with the 20-pound weights.
    2. Calculate the number of lifts needed with the 15-pound weights to match the total weight.
    3. Return the number of lifts needed.
    '''
    # Step 1: Calculate the total weight lifted with the 20-pound weights.
    weight_per_lift_20 = 2 * 20  # Two 20-pound weights
    total_lifts_20 = 12
    total_weight_20 = weight_per_lift_20 * total_lifts_20
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the number of lifts needed with the 15-pound weights to match the total weight.
    weight_per_lift_15 = 2 * 15  # Two 15-pound weights
    total_lifts_15 = total_weight_20 / weight_per_lift_15
    
    # Step 3: Return the number of lifts needed.
    return total_lifts_15
`Answer 2`: 16
`Evaluation`: Correct
