`Mistakes`: The first attempt incorrectly assumes that the carboxyl group will be protonated and thus have a positive charge, which is incorrect; protonation of the carboxyl group actually neutralizes its usual negative charge. Additionally, the amino and guanidinium groups should have positive charges, not the carboxyl group.

`Hint for a better Method choice`: Using Plan-and-then-Code would allow for a step-by-step computational approach that clarifies the net charge calculation, reducing the risk of conceptual errors.

`Mistakes`: The first attempt incorrectly assumes the charge state of the carboxyl group. At a low pH (below its pKa), the carboxyl group should be uncharged, not carrying a +1 charge. The amino group and guanidinium group are correctly assumed to be protonated and positively charged, but the carboxyl group is incorrectly assigned a positive charge rather than being neutral.

`Hint for a better Method choice`: To obtain an accurate net charge calculation, it is beneficial to use a method which explicitly calculates the charge state of each group at the given pH and sums them up systematically, avoiding the confusion with signs and the state of protonation.

1
`Mistakes`: The error in Attempt 1 is that the term b should be multiplied by the s term from the substitution $\dot{x}=se^{st}$, not added as a constant. Moreover, the characteristic polynomial should not have a constant term added; it is derived from the coefficients of $x$, $\dot{x}$, and $\ddot{x}$.

`Hint for a better Method choice`: A method that explicitly plans the substitution step-by-step and then encodes the result into a representation of the polynomial can avoid mistakes made by mental arithmetic or overlooking terms.



====================



1
`Mistakes`: The error in the first attempt is in forming the characteristic polynomial. The correct characteristic polynomial should have a term $bs$ rather than $b$, as $b$ is the coefficient of the first derivative $\dot{x}$, which becomes $s$ after substitution.

`Hint for a better Method choice`: Using a more structured approach such as planning and coding can help in carefully formulating the characteristic polynomial and ensuring mathematical accuracy in the substitution process.



====================



2
`Mistakes`: The error in the original solution lies in the squaring of $z^2$. The foil method was incorrectly applied because the signs of the terms within the expansion were not accurately handled. The computation of $(-2 + 2\sqrt{3}i)^2$ was incorrect. 

`Hint for a better Method choice`: Utilizing a program-aided method ensures precision in arithmetic operations and reduces the chances of making algebraic errors during expansion and simplification of the powers of $z$.



====================



2
`Mistakes`: The error in the original solution arises during the squaring of $z^2$ to obtain $z^4$. The calculation $( -2 + 2\sqrt{3}i)^2$ was done incorrectly. The mistake is in the term $-4(2\sqrt{3})i$ which should be $-4(2\sqrt{3})i^2$, and it should simplify to $-4 \cdot 2 \cdot -3$, resulting in a positive value rather than negative.

`Hint for a better Method choice`: Using Program-aided Language Model (pal) or Plan-and-then-Code (p2c) would help avoid simple algebraic errors and ensure precise computation of the powers of complex numbers.
