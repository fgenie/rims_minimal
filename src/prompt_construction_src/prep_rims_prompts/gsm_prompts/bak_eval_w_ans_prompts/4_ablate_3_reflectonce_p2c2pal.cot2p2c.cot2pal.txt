You are now solving math word problems. You brilliantly detects the errors in the wrong solution and find `Method` to correct the solution. The methods you are taking are as follows. Each has its strength and weakness:

- Chain of Thought (cot): Solving problem with writing steps of reasoning in a natural language. Might help correct understanding of the problem but this could be weaker in precise computation.
- Program-aided Language Modeling (pal): Using python language to reason and obtain an accurate answer to the given question, but this could be weaker in understanding the problem. 
- Plan-and-then-Code (p2c): When a question seems requiring amount of steps to reach the answer, write plans first for what to compute and write a python code to it for solving the problem. However if planning goes wrong, the code will also be wrong. If any steps of planning provided before programming, then it will be considered as Plan-and-then-Code.

Followings are the examples of correcting the wrong solutions with a `Method` based on diagnosis (`Mistakes`) and `Hint for a better Method choice`.




`Question`: Bella eats 6 apples a day. If during the week she consumes a third of the apples Grace picks, how many apples will Grace have after 6 weeks?
`Method`: Program-aided Language Modeling (pal)
`Attempt 1`: 
def solution():
    # Bella eats 6 apples a day
    apples_per_day_bella = 6

    # Number of days in a week
    days_per_week = 7

    # How many apples Bella eats in 1 week
    apples_per_week_bella = apples_per_day_bella * days_per_week

    # Since Bella eats a third of the apples Grace picks, Grace picks 3 times the amount Bella eats
    apples_per_week_grace = apples_per_week_bella * 3

    # Calculation for 6 weeks
    total_apples_6_weeks_grace = apples_per_week_grace * 6
    total_apples_6_weeks_bella = apples_per_week_bella * 6

    # Subtracting the apples Bella has eaten from Grace's total
    result = total_apples_6_weeks_grace - total_apples_6_weeks_bella
    return result

`Question`: Four small panda bears and five bigger panda bears eat 25 pounds and 40 pounds of fresh bamboo sprouts every day, respectively. How many pounds of bamboo do the 9 pandas eat in a week?
`Method`: Plan-and-then-Code (p2c)
`Attempt 1`: 1. Define a variable to represent the daily amount of bamboo eaten by small panda bears, let's call it `small_panda_bamboo_day` and set its value to 25 pounds.
2. Define another variable for the daily amount of bamboo eaten by bigger panda bears, name it `big_panda_bamboo_day` and set its value to 40 pounds.
3. Calculate the daily bamboo consumption for all small panda bears by multiplying `small_panda_bamboo_day` by the number of small panda bears (4). Let's call this result `total_small_panda_bamboo_day`.
4. Calculate the daily bamboo consumption for all bigger panda bears by multiplying `big_panda_bamboo_day` by the number of bigger panda bears (5). Let's call this result `total_big_panda_bamboo_day`.
5. Add `total_small_panda_bamboo_day` and `total_big_panda_bamboo_day` to find the total amount of bamboo eaten by all nine pandas in one day. Store this in a new variable called `total_bamboo_day`.
6. Since the question asks for the total amount of bamboo eaten in a week, multiply `total_bamboo_day` by 7 (the number of days in a week). Store this in a new variable called `total_bamboo_week`.
7. Return the value of `total_bamboo_week`, which represents the total pounds of bamboo the nine pandas eat in a week.
def solution():
    small_panda_bamboo_day = 25
    big_panda_bamboo_day = 40
    number_of_small_pandas = 4
    number_of_big_pandas = 5

    total_small_panda_bamboo_day = small_panda_bamboo_day * number_of_small_pandas
    total_big_panda_bamboo_day = big_panda_bamboo_day * number_of_big_pandas
    
    total_bamboo_day = total_small_panda_bamboo_day + total_big_panda_bamboo_day

    total_bamboo_week = total_bamboo_day * 7
    
    return total_bamboo_week

`Question`: Bella eats 6 apples a day. If during the week she consumes a third of the apples Grace picks, how many apples will Grace have after 6 weeks?
`Method`: Program-aided Language Modeling (pal)
`Attempt 1`: 
def solution():
    apples_bella_eats_per_day = 6
    days_per_week = 7
    weeks = 6
    
    # Calculate how many apples Bella eats in a week
    apples_bella_eats_per_week = apples_bella_eats_per_day * days_per_week
    
    # Assuming this is a third of what Grace picks, find out the total Grace picks
    apples_grace_picks_per_week = apples_bella_eats_per_week * 3
    
    # Calculate the total apples Grace picks in 6 weeks
    apples_grace_picks_total = apples_grace_picks_per_week * weeks
    
    # Since we are interested in how many apples Grace will have after Bella eats her share, 
    # we subtract the number of apples Bella eats in 6 weeks
    apples_bella_eats_in_6_weeks = apples_bella_eats_per_week * weeks
    
    # Calculate the remaining apples
    apples_grace_has_after = apples_grace_picks_total - apples_bella_eats_in_6_weeks
    
    return apples_grace_has_after

Now, try the `Question` below following the same procedure as above. Try the question with the choice of your `Method`, and evaluate the `Answer`. If your `Attempt` is considered wrong, identify the `Mistakes` and reason to take `Method` by writing `Hint for a better Method choice`. Based on it, make a correct reattempt.
