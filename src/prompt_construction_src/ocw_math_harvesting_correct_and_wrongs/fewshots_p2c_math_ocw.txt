    We are given a system of equations:
    6x - 4y = a  (1)

    We need to find the value of a/b, assuming x and y are both nonzero, and b is nonzero.

    Step by step, we can transform the system of equations to express a in terms of b:

    From equation (1), we can express x in terms of y and a:
    6x = a + 4y  =>  x = (a + 4y)/6  (3)

    Mistake: We can substitute x from equation (3) into equation (2) to find a relation between y and b, but we will make a mistake in the algebra:
    6y - 9((a + 4y)/6) = b
    Simplify the equation:
    6y - (3a + 12y)/2 = b
    Multiply through by 2:
    12y - 6a - 24y = 2b
    Simplify further:
    -12a = 2b  =>  a = -6b  (4)
