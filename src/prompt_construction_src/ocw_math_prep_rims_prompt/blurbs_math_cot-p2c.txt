`Question`: 
Problem:
Find the domain of the expression  $\frac{\sqrt{x-2}}{\sqrt{5-x}}$.}
`Method`: Chain of Thought (cot)
`Attempt 1`: 
Solution:
 For the expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$ to be defined, the value inside the square root must be non-negative. This means that both $x-2 \\ge 0$ and $5-x \\ge 0$.

 From $x-2 \\ge 0$, we get $x \\ge 2$.

 From $5-x \\ge 0$, we get $x \\le 5$.

 Combining the two inequalities, we have $2 \\le x \\le 5$.

 Therefore, the domain of the expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$ is $\\boxed{[2,5]}$.
`Answer 1`: $\boxed{[2,5]}$
`Evaluation`: Wrong
`Mistakes`: The error in the original attempt is in the interpretation of the condition for the denominator. While the square root requires the expression inside to be non-negative, as a denominator it additionally cannot be zero, thus $5-x$ has to be strictly greater than zero.
`Hint for a better Method choice`: Using the Plan-and-then-Code method can enforce a structured thinking process to plan out the logic before writing code that checks the domain conditions, ensuring both non-negativity and non-zero constraints are properly addressed.

`Attempt 2`: 
def solution():
    '''
    The domain of the expression $\frac{\sqrt{x-2}}{\sqrt{5-x}}$ is determined by the conditions under which both the numerator and denominator are defined and the denominator is not zero. Specifically:
    
    1. The numerator $\sqrt{x-2}$ requires $x-2 \geq 0$, which implies $x \geq 2$.
    2. The denominator $\sqrt{5-x}$ requires $5-x > 0$, which implies $x < 5$.
    
    Combining these two conditions, the domain of the expression is $2 \leq x < 5$.
    '''
    # Since the domain is a simple condition, we return it as a string, concisely with bracket and parenthesis.
    return "[2,5)"
`Answer 2`: [2,5)

`Question`: 
Problem:
If $\det \mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\det \mathbf{B} = 12,$ then find $\det (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{B}).$
`Method`: Chain of Thought (cot)
`Attempt 1`: 
The determinant of the product of two square matrices is equal to the sum of their determinants. Therefore, if you have two matrices $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ with determinants $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B} = 12$, respectively, then the determinant of their product $\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}$ is given by:

$$\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})+(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = 2 + 12 = 14$$

So, $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = 14$.
`Answer 1`: $\det (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{B}) = 14$
`Evaluation`: Wrong
`Mistakes`: The mistake in the first attempt is the incorrect assumption that the determinant of the product of two matrices is the sum of their determinants. In reality, the determinant of the product is the product of their determinants.
`Hint for a better Method choice`: Use the property that the determinant of a product of two matrices is the product of their determinants, which can be efficiently calculated using a simple program.
`Workaround Method`: Plan-and-then-Code (p2c)
`Attempt 2`: 
def solution():
    # Step 1: Given values for determinants of A and B
    det_A = 2
    det_B = 12

    # Step 2: Calculate the determinant of the product of matrices A and B
    det_product = det_A * det_B

    # Step 3: Return the result
    return det_product
`Answer 2`: 24

Problem:
If the system of equations

\begin{align*}
6x-4y&=a,\\
6y-9x &=b.
\end{align*}has a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,
find $\frac{a}{b},$ assuming $b$ is nonzero.
`Method`: Chain of Thought (cot)
`Attempt 1`: 
Solution:
To solve this system of equations, we can multiply the second equation by 2 to simplify the system:

\\begin{align*}
    6x - 4y &= a,\\\\
    12y - 18x &= 2b.
    \\end{align*}

Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate $x$:

\\begin{align*}
    6x - 4y + 12y - 18x &= a + 2b,\\\\
    -12x + 8y + 12y - 18x &= a + 2b,\\\\
    -30x + 20y &= a + 2b.
    \\end{align*}

Dividing the equation by 10, we get:

\\begin{align*}
    -3x + 2y &= \\frac{a + 2b}{10}.
    \\end{align*}

Since $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero, we can divide the equation by 2:

\\begin{align*}
    -1.5x + y &= \\frac{a + 2b}{20}.
    \\end{align*}

This implies that $\\frac{a}{b} = \\boxed{-3}$.
`Answer 1`: $\frac{a}{b} = \boxed{-3}$
`Evaluation`: Wrong
`Mistakes`: The attempt adds the multiplied second equation incorrectly, as instead of adding, the attempt mistakenly combines the coefficients which leads to an incorrect equation. Then, instead of finding \(\frac{a}{b}\), the attempt incorrectly computes \(\frac{a + 2b}{20}\).
`Hint for a better Method choice`: Coding allows for precise calculation and algebraic manipulation that minimizes human error when dealing with complex fractions or operations. It could better handle the simplification and substitution processes required to find the ratio \(\frac{a}{b}\).

    The function solution returns the answer to the algebraic problem presented.

    We are given a system of equations:
    6x - 4y = a  (1)
    6y - 9x = b  (2)

    We need to find the value of a/b, assuming x and y are both nonzero, and b is nonzero.

    Step by step, we can transform the system of equations to express a in terms of b:

    From equation (1), we can express x in terms of y and a:
    6x = a + 4y  =>  x = (a + 4y)/6  (3)

    We can substitute x from equation (3) into equation (2) to find a relation between y and b:
    6y - 9((a + 4y)/6) = b
    Simplify the equation:
    6y - (3/2)(a + 4y) = b
    Multiply through by 2 to clear the fraction:
    12y - 3a - 12y = 2b
    Simplify further:
    -3a = 2b  =>  a = -2b/3  (4)

    Now we have a in terms of b. The ratio a/b is then:
    a/b = (-2b/3) / b
    Simplify by canceling out b:
    a/b = -2/3

    Since this is a fixed algebraic solution, we simply return the result.

`Mistakes`: The error in the first attempt lies in the incorrect manipulation of the equations when they were combined. Specifically, there was incorrect elimination and summation of the terms involving $x$ and $y$. The attempt also concluded with an arbitrary division without justification, leading to an erroneous final ratio.
