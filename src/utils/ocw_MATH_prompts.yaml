      Problem:

      Solution:
      The answer is +2.                                                     
      Final answer: The final answer is +2. I hope it is correct.

      Solution:
      $z^{4}$ has argument $4 \pi / 3$ and radius 16 , so it's equal to $-8-8 \sqrt{3} i$. 
      Thus $a = -8, b = -8\sqrt 3$, and our answer is $\boxed{(-8, -8\sqrt{3})}$.
      Final answer: The final answer is (-8, -8\sqrt{3}). I hope it is correct.

      Solution:
      We can simplify with partial fractions:
      \[Y(s)=\\frac{1}{(s+a)(s+b)}=\\frac{C}{s+a}+\\frac{D}{s+b}\]\nfind the constants 
      \(C\) and \(D\) by setting \(s=-a\) and \(s=-b\)
      \[
        \begin{aligned}
        \frac{1}{(s+a)(s+b)} &=\\frac{C}{s+a}+\\frac{D}{s+b} \\\\
        1 &=C(s+b)+D(s+a) \\
        C &=\\frac{1}{b-a} \\
        D &=\\frac{1}{a-b}
        \end{aligned}
      \]
      therefore
      \[\nY(s)=\frac{1}{b-a} \frac{1}{s+a}-\frac{1}{b-a} \frac{1}{s+b}
      \]
      By looking up the inverse Laplace Transform of \(\frac{1}{s+b}\), we find the total 
      solution \(y(t)\)
      \[
        y(t)=\boxed{\frac{1}{b-a}\left(e^{-a t}-e^{-b t}\right)}
      \].
      Final answer: The final answer is \[\frac{1}{b-a}\left(e^{-a t}-e^{-b t}\right)\]. I hope it is correct.

      Solution:
      The characteristic polynomial is $p(s)=\\boxed{s^{2}+b s+1}$.
      Final answer: The final answer is $s^{2}+b s+1$. I hope it is correct.

      Problem:
      Terrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift the same total weight?

      Problem:
      If the system of equations

      \begin{align*}
      6x-4y&=a,\\
      6y-9x &=b.
      \end{align*}has a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,
      find $\frac{a}{b},$ assuming $b$ is nonzero.

      Solution:
      The expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore, $x-2 \ge 0$, so $x\ge2$, and $5 - x \ge 0$, so $x \le 5$. Also, the denominator cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain of the expression is $\boxed{[2,5)}$.
      Final Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$. I hope it is correct.

      Solution:
      We have that $\det (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{B}) = (\det \mathbf{A})(\det \mathbf{B}) = (2)(12) = \boxed{24}.$
      Final Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.

      Solution:
      If Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times, he lifts a total of $2\cdot 12\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\cdot15\cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:
      \begin{align*}
      30n&=480\\
      \Rightarrow\qquad n&=480/30=\boxed{16}
      \end{align*}
      Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.

      Solution:
      If we multiply the first equation by $-\frac{3}{2}$, we obtain

      $$6y-9x=-\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$, we have

      $$-\frac{3}{2}a=b\Rightarrow\frac{a}{b}=\boxed{-\frac{2}{3}}.$$
      Final Answer: The final answer is $-\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.
